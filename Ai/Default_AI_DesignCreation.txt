AI DESIGN TYPES DATA FILE - Normal
=======================================================================================

New Design Created - 
  A design is created when a new Component or Vehicle Size has been researched 
  after the date the design was created. All Vehicle Sizes as fair game, and any 
  components which are part of the design type.

Vehicle Size Used Requirements - 
  Vehicle Type is correct for this Design Type.
  Have the necessary tech for this Vehicle Size.
  Vehicle Size discovery date is equal to or better than that of the last 
    design for this Design Type.
  Vehicle Size falls within the required Minimum and Maximum range of Tonnage.
  Can support the minimum and maximum required speeds.
    (enough spaces for engines to provide the minimum speed)
    (allows no movement for a Maximum Speed of zero) 
  Does not have any Min Percent requirements for a comp type different
    than the Majority Comp Type.
  Does not have any Max Percent requirements for the Majority Comp Type.
