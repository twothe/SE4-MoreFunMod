AI CONSTRUCTION FACILITIES DATA FILE - Normal
=======================================================================================

Construction Queue Type:
  Homeworld, Mining Colony, Farming Colony, Refining Colony,
  Resupply Base, Research Compound, Intelligence Compound, Construction Yard,
  Military Installation

AI State:
  Exploration, Infrastructure, Prepare for Attack, Attack, 
  Secure Holdings After Attack, Incursion, Prepare for Defense, 
  Defend (Short Term), Defend (Long Term), Not Connected 


Rules:
  1. If there is no facility with the given ability type (have not achieved that
     technology), then facility is not built.
  2. Only queues that match the current AI State will be evaluated.
  3. When facility space on a planet runs out, no more facility entries will be
     evaluated (so put the facilities you must have on the planet first).
  4. If ability is used at a system level (Spaceport, Resupply Depot, etc), 
     then item will only be constructed if it doesn't already exist in the 
     system.
