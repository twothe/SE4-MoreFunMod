AI PLANET TYPES DATA FILE - Normal
=======================================================================================

When a new planet is colonized, we use this list to determine what type
of planet it should be. We start with the first item in the list and
work our way down evaluating its criteria. If we reach the last item in 
the list, it will be used regardless of its criteria.

AI State:
  Exploration, Infrastructure, Prepare for Attack, Attack, 
  Secure Holdings After Attack, Incursion, Prepare for Defense, 
  Defend (Short Term), Defend (Long Term), Not Connected 

Planet Type:
  Homeworld, Mining Colony, Farming Colony, Refining Colony,
  Resupply Base, Research Compound, Intelligence Compound, Construction Yard,
  Military Installation

Max Per System:
  Maximum number of this planet type per system.

Percent of Colonies:
  Maximum percentage of all colonies can be of this type.

Minimum Planet Size for Type:
  The minimum planet size for this planet type.

Mineral Value, Organics Value, Radioactives Value:
  The approximate percentage value a planet must have to be selected
  as this planet type. These are used as a ratio in relation to each other.
  If this is zero, then this is not used. 
  
  For example, if the values are 110, 100, 100, then the planet must be at least
  110% above the norm in minerals to be used. 

Maximum Total in Empire:
  Total number of these colonies allowed in the empire. If this is zero, then 
  an unlimited number are allowed.
