Neo-Expansion Pack v1.30
Feb 2004

Description:
============
Here are some neostandard images to expand the shipsets provided with SE4. These images will not be used in the standard game, but will be used by various mods, including the sci-fi crossover mod, the ultimate vehiclesize mod, Devnullmod Gold and Proportions mod. This expansion pack is not in any way required to play these mods, but will add a little more variety and flavour. 

Installation:
=============
Just extract the archive into your SE4 directory. The neo-expansion images *should* find their way into the appropriate subfolders of your "Pictures" Folder.

Images:
=======

Some of these images have been created by modifying the original race artwork supplied with the game, while others (ie most infantry, all worldships) have been drawn or modelled from scratch. See the file "project.xls" for more details.
